--486 Updating a Reservation 
ReservationCard 
- Implement a route for /account/reservations/edit/${id}
- Get the reservation-edit page from the starter files
  - Get the current booking that you are trying to edit - data-service - getBooking
  - Create a new server action called updateReservation - add the server action to the form with all fields passed in with the correct name - note user authentication so that a user can only edit their own reservations
  - Pass the bookingId into the form action - add a hidden field (input with type set to hidden, set value prop to bookingId) to the form - use updateBooking code in data-service
  - Redirect back to the reservation page - use the redirect function from next/navigation (read documentation)
  - Revalidate the correct cache before redirecting
